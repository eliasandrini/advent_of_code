Personal repository with my solutions to the problems of Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/).
Most of the solutions are in C++, however I plan in doing some of them in Python as well.
Unfortunately I lost many solutions of previous years so only there are only recent years' solutions.

C++ files are build using `g++ <filename> -O2` and executed using `./a.out < input.txt`. This way I can avoid having to handle input file stream every time.
